# Video Game Creator

This skill guides you through the process of creating a video game concept, from initial ideation to polished writing. It is divided into several specialized modules.

## Workflow

1.  **World Building**: Establish the setting and rules of your game world.
    -   See [references/world-building.md](references/world-building.md)
2.  **Plot Design**: Structure the narrative arc and main quests.
    -   See [references/plot-design.md](references/plot-design.md)
3.  **Character Development**: Create compelling protagonists, antagonists, and NPCs.
    -   See [references/character.md](references/character.md)
4.  **Writing**: Draft dialogue, flavor text, and item descriptions.
    -   See [references/writing.md](references/writing.md)
5.  **Revision**: Refine and polish your content based on feedback or self-review.
    -   See [references/revision.md](references/revision.md)

## Usage

You can start with any module, but a typical flow begins with World Building or Plot Design.

-   To start world building, ask: "Help me design the world for a fantasy RPG."
-   To work on plot, ask: "I need a plot outline for a sci-fi shooter."
-   To create characters, ask: "Let's make a villain for my horror game."

## Tips

-   **Consistency**: Ensure that choices made in one module (e.g., World Building) are reflected in others (e.g., Character).
-   **Iterate**: Game design is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to revisit earlier steps as your ideas evolve.
