# Writing Game Text

This module focuses on writing the actual text players will encounter in your game. Effective writing is concise, clear, and flavorful.

## Core Elements

When writing for video games, consider the following:

1.  **Dialogue**:
    -   **Style**: Does it fit the setting and tone? (e.g., archaic fantasy vs. modern slang).
    -   **Pacing**: Keep it moving. Don't bog down players with huge text walls.
    -   **Subtext**: What characters *don't* say is often as important as what they do.

2.  **Flavor Text**:
    -   **Items / Spells**: Brief descriptions that add lore and color (e.g., "A rusted dagger. Used by thieves, forgotten by heroes.").
    -   **Locations**: Signs, journals, computer terminals.
    -   **Loading Screens**: Tips or snippets of lore.

3.  **Instructional Text**:
    -   **Tutorials**: Clear, concise instructions on how to play.
    -   **Objectives**: "Go to X," "Defeat Y," "Collect Z."
    -   **UI / Menus**: Labels, tooltips, warnings.

4.  **Tone & Voice**:
    -   **Consistency**: Maintain the same voice throughout the game (unless deliberately changing perspective).
    -   **Perspective**: First-person ("I open the chest"), second-person ("You see a chest"), or third-person ("The hero approaches the chest").

## Process

1.  **Start with Function**: What does the player need to know right now?
2.  **Add Flavor**: Can you convey that information in a more interesting way? (e.g., instead of "Press A to jump," maybe "Leap across the chasm!").
3.  **Read Aloud**: Dialogue should sound natural when spoken.
4.  **Cut the Fluff**: Remove unnecessary words. Players skim text.

## Example Prompts

-   "Write flavor text for a legendary sword called 'Dawnbreaker'."
-   "Create a tutorial prompt for a stealth mechanic."
-   "Draft a journal entry found in an abandoned laboratory."
