# World Building

This module helps you create a rich, believable setting for your video game. A well-designed world enhances player immersion and provides a foundation for gameplay and narrative.

## Core Elements

When building a world, consider the following key aspects:

1.  **Geography**:
    -   **Map**: What is the layout of the world? Are there continents, islands, distinct biomes?
    -   **Climate**: How does weather affect gameplay or story?
    -   **Resources**: What materials are abundant or scarce? How does this drive conflict?

2.  **History**:
    -   **Timeline**: Outline major events leading up to the start of the game.
    -   **Myths & Legends**: What do people believe about the past?
    -   **Ruins**: Are there physical remnants of past civilizations?

3.  **Culture & Society**:
    -   **Factions**: Who are the major groups (political, religious, economic)?
    -   **Customs**: What are the daily rituals, taboos, and traditions?
    -   **Language**: Are there unique dialects or naming conventions?

4.  **Technology & Magic**:
    -   **Tech Level**: Is it primitive, medieval, industrial, or futuristic?
    -   **Magic System**: If magic exists, what are its rules, costs, and limitations?
    -   **Integration**: How do technology and magic coexist?

## Process

1.  **Start Small**: Begin with the immediate area where the game starts (e.g., a village, a space station).
2.  **Expand Outward**: As the player progresses, reveal more of the world.
3.  **Ask "Why?"**: Everything should have a reason. Why is this castle here? Why do they worship this god?
4.  **Show, Don't Just Tell**: convey world-building through environmental storytelling (architecture, graffiti, item descriptions) rather than just exposition dumps.

## Example Prompts

-   "Create a geography for a post-apocalyptic desert world where water is currency."
-   "Develop a magic system based on sound and music."
-   "Outline the history of a space colony that lost contact with Earth 100 years ago."
