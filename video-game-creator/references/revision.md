# Revision

This module helps you refine and polish your video game content. Great games are not just written; they are rewritten.

## Core Elements

When revising your work, consider the following:

1.  **Playtesting Feedback**:
    -   **Confusion**: Where did players get stuck or lost?
    -   **Difficulty**: Was it too easy or too hard?
    -   **Engagement**: Were players bored?

2.  **Consistency**:
    -   **Lore**: Do characters contradict themselves? (e.g., "Magic is forbidden," then uses magic).
    -   **Tone**: Does the mood shift jarringly? (e.g., serious horror -> slapstick comedy).

3.  **Clarity & Flow**:
    -   **Pacing**: Does the story drag in the middle? Are cutscenes too long?
    -   **Dialogue**: Does everyone sound the same? Can you tighten it up?

4.  **Polish**:
    -   **Typos / Grammar**: Fix errors. Use a spellchecker.
    -   **Formatting**: Ensure text fits in UI boxes.
    -   **Readability**: Use simple language unless intentional (e.g., alien speech).

## Process

1.  **Wait**: Take a break from your work so you can see it with fresh eyes.
2.  **Get Feedback**: Ask friends, other developers, or potential players to review.
3.  **Be Brutal**: Cut scenes or mechanics that don't serve the core experience. Kill your darlings.
4.  **Iterate**: Make changes based on feedback and test again.

## Example Prompts

-   "Review this quest dialogue for pacing issues."
-   "Check this character bio for contradictions with established lore."
-   "Suggest ways to make this tutorial clearer for new players."
