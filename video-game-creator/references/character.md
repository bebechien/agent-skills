# Character Development

This module helps you create memorable and relatable characters for your video game. Strong characters make players care about the story and its stakes.

## Core Elements

When developing characters, consider the following:

1.  **Archetypes**:
    -   **Protagonist**: The player's avatar. What motivates them? What is their background?
    -   **Antagonist**: The villain or opposing force. Why are they a threat? Are they sympathetic?
    -   **Supporting Cast**: Mentors, companions, comic relief. How do they aid or hinder the protagonist?

2.  **Backstory**:
    -   **Origin**: Where did they come from? How did they get here?
    -   **Trauma / Strength**: What events shaped them?
    -   **Relationships**: Who do they love, hate, or fear?

3.  **Motivation**:
    -   **Goal**: What do they want? (e.g., revenge, redemption, treasure).
    -   **Conflict**: What stands in their way? (Internal: doubt, guilt. External: enemies, environment).
    -   **Arc**: How do they change throughout the story?

4.  **Appearance**:
    -   **Visuals**: Describe their clothing, scars, weapons, or distinct features.
    -   **Voice**: Consider tone, accent, and vocabulary.

## Process

1.  **Start with Function**: What role does the character play? (e.g., "The wise mentor who dies early").
2.  **Add Flaws**: Perfect characters are boring. Give them weaknesses.
3.  **Create Connections**: How do characters relate to each other? (e.g., brothers, rivals, ex-lovers).
4.  **Dialogue**: Write a few lines of dialogue to find their voice.

## Example Prompts

-   "Create a character sheet for a rogue spaceship captain."
-   "Develop a backstory for a villain who believes they are saving the world."
-   "Write a dialogue between two soldiers discussing the upcoming battle."
