# Plot Design

This module focuses on creating a compelling and interactive story structure for your video game. A strong plot motivates the player and provides context for their actions.

## Core Elements

When designing your plot, consider the following:

1.  **Structure**:
    -   **Linear vs. Non-Linear**: Is the story a straight line or a branching tree? Does player choice matter?
    -   **Quest Structure**:
        -   **Main Quest**: The core narrative thread (e.g., "Defeat the Demon King").
        -   **Side Quests**: Optional content that fleshes out the world (e.g., "Find the missing cat").
    -   **Pacing**: Ensure a good mix of intense action, exploration, and quiet moments.

2.  **Narrative Arc**:
    -   **Hook / Inciting Incident**: What starts the adventure? Why should the player care?
    -   **Rising Action**: Obstacles, mini-bosses, revelations that raise the stakes.
    -   **Climax**: The ultimate confrontation or turning point.
    -   **Resolution**: The aftermath and consequences of the player's choices.

3.  **Themes**:
    -   **Motif**: Recurring symbols or ideas (e.g., light vs. dark, nature vs. machine).
    -   **Message**: What is the game *really* about? (e.g., friendship, sacrifice, survival).

4.  **Dialogue & Interaction**:
    -   **Cutscenes**: Use sparingly for critical moments.
    -   **Dialogue Trees**: Give players agency in conversations.
    -   **Environmental Storytelling**: Tell the story through the level design (e.g., a ruined lab with audio logs).

## Process

1.  **Logline**: Summarize the game in one sentence. (e.g., "A courier navigates a post-nuclear wasteland to deliver a package that could save humanity.")
2.  **Synopsis**: Write a short paragraph outlining the beginning, middle, and end.
3.  **Outline**: Break the story into chapters or levels.
4.  **Flowchart**: Visualize the branching paths if applicable.

## Example Prompts

-   "Develop a plot outline for a cyberpunk detective game."
-   "Create side quest ideas for a fantasy village plagued by goblins."
-   "Write a branching dialogue tree for an interrogation scene."
